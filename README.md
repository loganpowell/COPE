## Problem Statement

We face an ever-expanding variety of platforms vying for
their stakeholders' attention. Customer liaisons and Public
Affairs are scrambling to keep up. Manually managing content
publication across this ecosystem is only going to become
more difficult as time goes on. New interfaces are cropping
up every year and we need a way to easily target them when
they do. We propose a platform built with tech already
approved for use at Census to empower us to move deeper into
the 21st century engagement landscape.
 
## Create Once Publish Everywhere (COPE) Platform

- Powered by free/open source software 
- Built on free/cheap approved cloud infrastructure (Amazon Web Services)
- Bottom-dollar publication services (free for many if under
  their monthly account free tier) and utility/pay-by-use
  pricing rather than large presumptuous contracts that
  could go to waste
